Think games are just to waste time while waiting at an airport, train station or long trip? Think again because game designers are designing games in ways that can help improve reading, vocabulary and problem solving skills. 
Have you ever bought or downloaded a computer or iOS game without much (or any) instruction on how it works? This is called “blank slating” and it’s a problem in productivity software, but it has a benefit in games. People like to figure things out and games like these offer a benefit to parents and educators. Now in order to play the game, the user has to figure out how the game works.

Wordoko teaches Japanese language skills, but it also opens the door to a new world of Japanese literature and culture by learning Kanji. Additionally, because of the format of the game, it is always available, no need to be connected to the internet. If you have a few moments, you have time to practice your reading and language skills.
Wordoko hopes to use these approaches in its learning methodologies. When the game is downloaded, there is a short tutorial, but the word searches are presented in Kana and Kanji allowing users to learn words between the three letter sets.
